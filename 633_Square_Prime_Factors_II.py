# PE633 - Square Prime Factors II
import math


# Approach:
# 1 - Find list of primes less than or equal to N.
# 2 - Multiply each number in list by every other number in list.
# 3 - If squares are less than or equal to N, increment C sum.
# 4 - Any non-squares that are less or equal to the square root on N
#     are added to the list.
# 5 - Repeat from step 2, by multiplying new entries by full list.
# 6 - Stop when every product is greater than N.



#A simple sieve technique to create a single long list of all prime numbers below "limit".
#This is useful for generating a list of primes to iterate through. Not as efficient for
#generating a list of primes to find a specific value in.
